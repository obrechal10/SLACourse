Their big breaktGateshrough came in 1980 when Microsoft partnered with IBM to develop an operating system called MS-DOS. The software quickly became the industry standard,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; with computers. As Microsoft released later versions of Windows, &emsp;including the widely successful Windows 95, it became the dominant player in the PC market. Gates, known for his sharp intellect and competitive nature, was instrumental in shaping Microsoft’s aggressive business strategies. By 1995, he had become the richest person in the world, a position he held for many years. Under his leadership, Microsoft expanded into productivity software, including Microsoft Office, and solidified its place in both home and corporate computing.

Despite his success, Gates and Microsoft faced scrutiny. In the late 1990s, the U.S&emsp;&emsp;. government filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Microsoft of monopolistic practices, &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;particularly for bundling Internet Explorer with Windows. &emsp;&emsp;The case led to a settlement in 2000. That same year, Gates stepped down as CEO, appointing Steve Ballmer as his successor, though he remained chairman and chief software architect. Over time, Gates shifted his focus toward philanthropy. In 2000, he and his wife Melinda established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has since become one of the world’s&emsp; largest private charitable organizations.&emsp;&emsp; The foundation focuses on global health,&emsp; education, poverty alleviation, and expanding access to technology and vaccines, particularly in developing nations. Gates has donated tens of billions of dollars to these causes and co-founded the Giving Pledge, encouraging other billionaires to commit most of their wealth to charity.
